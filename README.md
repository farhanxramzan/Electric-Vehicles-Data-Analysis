**Project Summary: Analysis of Electric Vehicles in the United States Using Tableau**

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States, utilizing Tableau for data visualization and insights. The primary focus was on two types of electric vehicles: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The analysis encompassed various EV brands, including Tesla, Toyota, and Nissan, providing a detailed overview of the current EV landscape.

**Key Elements of the Project:**

1. **Data Segmentation by EV Types:**
   - **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):** Fully electric vehicles with no internal combustion engine.
   - **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):** Vehicles that combine a conventional internal combustion engine with an electric propulsion system, which can be recharged by plugging into an external source of electric power.

2. **Brand Analysis:**
   - The analysis included popular brands such as Tesla, Toyota, and Nissan, highlighting their market presence and the distribution of their EV models across the country.

3. **Visualization Techniques:**
   - **Bar Charts:** Used to compare the number of BEVs and PHEVs across different brands. This helped in identifying the leading brands in the EV market.
   - **Maps:** Geographic distribution of EVs was visualized using a map, showing the concentration of EVs in various states. This provided insights into regional adoption patterns and potential market opportunities.
   - **Top 10 Filters:** Applied filters to highlight the top 10 states with the highest number of EVs. This allowed for a focused analysis of the most significant markets for electric vehicles.

**Insights Gained:**
- Tesla emerged as the dominant brand in the BEV category, with a significant market share compared to other brands.
- Toyota and Nissan showed a more balanced distribution between BEVs and PHEVs, indicating their diversified approach to the EV market.
- The map visualization revealed that states like California, New York, and Texas have the highest concentrations of electric vehicles, reflecting their supportive policies and infrastructure for EV adoption.
- The top 10 filters provided a quick snapshot of the leading states in EV adoption, helping to identify key regions driving the market growth.

This project not only showcased the current trends and distribution of electric vehicles in the United States but also highlighted the importance of brand strategies and regional policies in shaping the EV market. Through effective use of Tableau, the analysis provided actionable insights that could inform future marketing, sales, and policy-making decisions in the EV sector.
